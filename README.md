# if-elif-else

I performed the following steps in Visual Studio:
● I created a new Python file called age-quiz.py. I used the input method to output various responses determined by the data the user entered.
● If the user is 40 or over, the output message is "You're over the hill."
● I wrote a code to take in a user’s age and store it in an integer variable called
age.
● Assuming that the oldest someone can be is 100; if the user enters a
higher number, the output message is "Sorry, you're dead.".
● If the user is 65 or older, the output message is "Enjoy your retirement!"
● If the user is under 13, the output message is "You qualify for the kiddie
discount."
● If the user is 21, the output message is "Congrats on your 21st!"
● For any other age, the output message was "Age is but a number."

● Note:
o You should use the if-elif-else statement structure to create the
program.
o Note that the order in which you set up the conditions is
important; you will need to work out what makes sense in terms
of the logical tests applied to the ages
